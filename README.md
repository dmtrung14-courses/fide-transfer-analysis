# FIDE Transfers Analysis
Final Project for UMass STATS 516 class. [Paper](https://github.com/dmtrung14-courses/fide-transfer-analysis/blob/main/FIDE-transfer-analysis.pdf)

## Abstract

In this report, we explore the transfer trends of chess players worldwide. We use the data from the FiveThirtyEight's Article: [American Chess Is Great Again](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/american-chess-is-great-again/), and the [dataset](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/chess-transfers) of all FIDE-officiated transfers from 2001 to 2017. More insights into the dataset will be provided in the following section of the report. We will delve into the article's central claim, which attributes the recent USA Team victories to importing top players worldwide, by comparing US-imported players' quality (ELO/Ranking) versus the rest of the world. Finally, we will discuss the result's implications, and provide additional reference resources to back our claims.
